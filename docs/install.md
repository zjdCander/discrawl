# Install

Discrawl is a single Go binary. Install via Homebrew or build from source.

## Homebrew

```bash
brew install openclaw/tap/discrawl
discrawl --version
```

The tap auto-installs from `openclaw/tap`.

## Check for updates

```bash
discrawl check-update
discrawl check-update --json
```

Interactive terminal runs perform a cached daily release check and print a
stderr notice when a newer Discrawl release is available. Scripted, JSON, CI,
and non-TTY runs skip the passive notice. Set `DISCRAWL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` or
`CRAWLKIT_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable it.

## From source

Requires Go `1.26+`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/discrawl.git
cd discrawl
go build -o bin/discrawl ./cmd/discrawl
./bin/discrawl --version
```

If you do not put `discrawl` on `PATH`, replace `discrawl` with `./bin/discrawl` in any example below.

## Quick start (with bot token)

```bash
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-bot-token"
discrawl init
discrawl doctor
discrawl sync --full
discrawl sync
discrawl search "panic: nil pointer"
discrawl tail
```

`init` discovers accessible guilds and writes the default XDG config file. If
exactly one guild is available, it becomes the default automatically.

`doctor` verifies the config loads, the token resolves, the bot can reach the
Gateway, and the local DB and FTS index are wired up.

## Quick start (Git-only reader)

No Discord credentials required. You read a private Git snapshot another machine published.

```bash
discrawl subscribe https://github.com/example/discord-archive.git
discrawl search "launch checklist"
discrawl messages --channel general --hours 24
```

`subscribe` writes a token-free config (`discord.token_source = "none"`) and
imports the snapshot. Read commands auto-refresh when the local snapshot is
older than `15m`.

For Worker-fronted archives that should stay fully remote:

```bash
discrawl subscribe-cloud --endpoint https://crawl.example.workers.dev --archive openclaw/discord
discrawl status --json
```

This writes read-only `[remote]` config and does not create a local SQLite
database.

## Default runtime paths

Discrawl follows the OS storage convention instead of writing a new top-level directory in your
home folder. Linux uses XDG Base Directory paths. macOS uses `~/Library` folders unless you set XDG
variables yourself.

- Linux config: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/discrawl/config.toml`
- Linux database/share: `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/discrawl/`
- Linux cache: `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/discrawl/`
- Linux logs: `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/discrawl/logs/`
- macOS config/database/logs/share: `~/Library/Application Support/discrawl/`
- macOS cache: `~/Library/Caches/discrawl/`

Upgrades do not move your database automatically. Existing
`~/.discrawl/config.toml` installs continue to load when the new default config
file does not exist, even if XDG variables are set globally by your desktop.
Existing legacy runtime paths keep winning until the matching new path exists.
To migrate deliberately, copy or create the new config file first, or point
Discrawl at it with `--config` / `DISCRAWL_CONFIG`, then copy the database and
share directory you want to preserve.
